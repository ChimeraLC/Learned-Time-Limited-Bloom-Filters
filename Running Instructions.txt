To run the experiments generate the plots, run main.py.

The hyperparameters of the binary classification model can be changed in args.json,
and the model can either be "lstm" or "linear" for either type of model. It will
train a new model the first time, but is a saved model exists, it will load it
instead.

To generate the false username data if it is missing, run gen_false_usernames.py.
The full player data is included in data/player-stats.csv, and an abreviated version
is included in data/player-stats-abriv.csv, which can be replacted in the parameters
if necessary.

Parameters for the experiments can be passed through the command line, but can also be
set in the get_args() function in main, where the filter_generations (k, l), 
filter_generation_sizes (g), filter_fps (aimed fps) and usuals_proportion
(proportion of usernames that come from the 'common' dataset) can be set. By default,
they are the parameters used in the report.

main.py will then run all the corresponding experiments, outputting the results
to the console and additionally generating and displaying the plots at the end.
